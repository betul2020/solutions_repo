Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

Motivation

The concept of escape velocity is crucial for understanding the conditions required to leave a celestial body's gravitational influence. Extending this concept, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the thresholds for orbiting, escaping, and leaving a star system. These principles underpin modern space exploration, from launching satellites to interplanetary missions.

1. Definitions and Physical Meaning

First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): The minimum speed required for an object to maintain a stable orbit around a celestial body without falling back or drifting away. For a circular orbit, it depends on the body's mass and the orbital radius. Physically, it balances gravitational pull with centrifugal force.

Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): The speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body entirely, reaching infinity with zero kinetic energy. It is the threshold to break free from the body's gravity.

Third Cosmic Velocity (Escape from Star System): The speed required to escape the gravitational pull of a star system (e.g., the Solar System), considering the mass of the star and the distance from it. This applies to interstellar travel.

2. Mathematical Derivations and Parameters

The velocities can be derived using gravitational principles. Letâ€™s denote:


$G$ = Gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} , \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2}$)

$M$ = Mass of the celestial body (kg)


$R$ = Radius of the orbit or body (m)


$m$ = Mass of the object (kg, often cancels out)

First Cosmic Velocity

For a circular orbit: $ v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} $

This arises from equating gravitational force to centripetal force: $ \frac{GMm}{R^2} = \frac{mv_1^2}{R} $.

3. Calculations and Visualizations

Below is a Python script to calculate and visualize the velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. The script uses matplotlib for graphical representations.
