Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic problem in mechanics that describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, neglecting air resistance initially. Let\u2019s derive the governing equations from Newton\u2019s second law and establish the family of solutions based on initial conditions. Derivation of Equations of Motion Consider a projectile launched from the origin \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. The only force acting is gravity, with acceleration \\(g\\) downward. We break the motion into horizontal ( \\(x\\) ) and vertical ( \\(y\\) ) components. Horizontal motion : No acceleration, so: $$ a_x = 0 $$ Initial velocity: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) Position: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion : Acceleration due to gravity, \\(a_y = -g\\) : Initial velocity: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Velocity: $$ v_y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Position: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ These are parametric equations describing a parabolic trajectory. The family of solutions depends on the free parameters: \\(v_0\\) (initial speed), \\(\\theta\\) (angle of projection), and \\(g\\) (gravitational acceleration). Varying these parameters generates different trajectories. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . Set \\(y(t) = 0\\) and solve for time of flight \\(t_f\\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factorize: \\[ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 \\] Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) (landing) Substitute \\(t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] Dependence on Angle \\(\\theta\\) Range \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) , i.e., \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , so \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . \\(R = 0\\) when \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) (no horizontal motion).

Air resistance : Introduce a drag term, e.g., \\(-k v\\) , requiring numerical solutions. 4. Implementation Below is a Python script using NumPy and Matplotlib to simulate and visualize the range as a function of \\(\\theta\\) for different \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) . Discussion on Model Constrains The basic model assumes: Absence of air friction: In reality, projectiles lose speed, which decreases their travel distance.

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) . Implications in Astronomy Mass Determination: Measure \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) of a satellite or moon to calculate \\(M\\) of the central body.

Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities Motivation Escape velocity defines the speed needed to break free from a gravitational field, while cosmic velocities extend this to orbiting and escaping larger systems, critical for space exploration. Definitions and Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): Speed for a circular orbit at radius \\(r\\) : \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\) Derived from balancing gravitational and centripetal forces. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): Speed to escape from radius \\(r\\) to infinity: Energy: \\(\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{G M m}{r}\\) \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_1\\) Third Cosmic Velocity: Speed to escape a star system (e.g., Earth escaping the Sun from its orbit). Approximate as escape from Sun\u2019s field at 1 AU: \\(v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{r_{\\text{AU}}}} \\approx 42.1\\) km/s (from Earth\u2019s orbit). Adjusted for Earth\u2019s motion: \\(v_3 \\approx 16.6\\) km/s relative to Earth. Parameters \\(M\\) : Mass of the body \\(r\\) : Distance from center \\(G\\) : Constant Calculations Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, \\(r = 6,371\\) km: \\(v_1 = 7.9\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 11.2\\) km/s Mars: \\(M = 6.417 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, \\(r = 3,390\\) km: \\(v_1 = 3.6\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 5.0\\) km/s Jupiter: \\(M = 1.898 \\times 10^{27}\\) kg, \\(r = 69,911\\) km: \\(v_1 = 42.1\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 59.5\\) km/s Importance in Space Exploration Satellites: \\(v_1\\) for low Earth orbit (LEO). Planetary Missions: \\(v_2\\) to leave Earth; \\(v_3\\) for solar system escape (e.g., Voyager). Problem 3: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth Motivation A payload released from a rocket follows a trajectory shaped by initial velocity and Earth\u2019s gravity, key to mission design. Possible Trajectories Elliptical: If \\(v < v_2\\) , orbits Earth. Parabolic: If \\(v = v_2\\) , escapes to infinity with zero residual speed. Hyperbolic: If \\(v > v_2\\) , escapes with excess speed. Numerical Analysis Use Newton\u2019s gravitation: \\(\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{G M}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\\) .

A Python script is provided to compute and visualize these velocities, aiding in understanding their implications for space mission planning. Theoretical Framework Escape Velocity Escape velocity ($ v_{\\text{esc}} $) is the minimum speed required for an object to escape the gravitational pull of a celestial body without further propulsion. It is derived from the conservation of mechanical energy, where the total energy (kinetic + potential) at the surface equals zero at infinity: [ \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\text{esc}}^2 - \\frac{G M m}{r} = 0 ] Solving for $ v_{\\text{esc}} $: [ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mu}{r}} ] where: $ G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} , \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} $ is the gravitational constant, $ M $ is the mass of the celestial body (kg), $ r $ is the radius from the center (typically surface radius, m), $ \\mu = G M $ is the gravitational parameter (m\u00b3/s\u00b2), $ m $ is the mass of the escaping object (cancels out). Cosmic Velocities The cosmic velocities are specific thresholds related to orbital and escape dynamics, often defined in the context of Earth but applicable to other bodies: First Cosmic Velocity ($ v_1 $): The minimum speed for a circular orbit at the surface of a celestial body (orbital velocity): [ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}} ] This assumes a low-altitude circular orbit, neglecting atmospheric drag. Second Cosmic Velocity ($ v_2 $): Equivalent to the escape velocity, the speed required to escape the gravitational field: [ v_2 = v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_1 ] Third Cosmic Velocity ($ v_3 $): The speed required to escape the star system (e.g., the Solar System for Earth) from the surface of the celestial body. For a planet orbiting a star, it involves escaping the planet's gravity and achieving a velocity relative to the star that allows escape from the star's gravitational field. For a planet at distance $ R $ from a star of mass $ M_{\\text{star}} $, the planet's orbital velocity around the star is: [ v_{\\text{orbit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_{\\text{star}}}{R}} ] The escape velocity from the star at the planet\u2019s orbit is: [ v_{\\text{esc,star}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{star}}}{R}} = \\sqrt{2} v_{\\text{orbit}} ] The third cosmic velocity is the velocity needed at the planet\u2019s surface to achieve a hyperbolic orbit relative to the star, accounting for the planet\u2019s orbital velocity. A simplified approximation (assuming the planet\u2019s escape and the star\u2019s escape are sequential) is: [ v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{v_2^2 + v_{\\text{esc,star}}^2} ] However, for precise calculations, we solve the energy equations considering the planet\u2019s motion in the star\u2019s frame, but here we use the approximation for simplicity.

Interstellar Travel: Escaping the Solar System demands $ v_3 $, a significant barrier. Current missions (e.g., Voyager) rely on gravity assists to approach this velocity, but future propulsion technologies (e.g., nuclear or ion engines) may target $ v_3 $ directly. Influencing Factors Mass and Radius: Jupiter\u2019s high $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $ reflect its massive size, making launches from its surface impractical. Mars\u2019 lower velocities facilitate easier escapes. Distance from Sun: Planets farther from the Sun (e.g., Jupiter) have lower $ v_3 $ due to reduced solar gravitational influence at larger $ R $. Atmospheric Drag: Not modeled here, but significant for bodies like Earth, increasing required launch velocities. Limitations The model assumes point-mass gravity, ignoring non-spherical effects or atmospheric drag.

The study includes: - Classification of possible trajectories (elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic) based on initial conditions. - Numerical simulation of the payload's path using given position, velocity, and altitude. - Discussion of trajectories in the context of orbital insertion, reentry, and escape scenarios. - Development of a Python-based computational tool to simulate and visualize the motion. The simulation employs numerical methods to solve the equations of motion, providing graphical representations to illustrate the payload's behavior and its implications for space missions. Theoretical Framework Gravitational Dynamics The motion of the payload is governed by Newton's Law of Gravitation : \\[ F = -\\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] where: - $ G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} $ is the gravitational constant, - $ M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} $ is Earth's mass, - $ m $ is the payload's mass, - $ r $ is the distance from Earth's center to the payload, - $ \\hat{r} $ is the radial unit vector. The acceleration in Cartesian coordinates \\((x, y)\\) is: \\[ \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{\\mu}{r^3} \\mathbf{r} \\] where $ \\mathbf{r} = (x, y) $, $ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $, and $ \\mu = G M = 3.986 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{s}^{-2} $ is Earth's gravitational parameter. Trajectory Classification The trajectory is determined by the specific mechanical energy ($ \\epsilon $): \\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\] where $ v $ is the payload's speed. The energy classifies the trajectory: - Elliptical : $ \\epsilon < 0 $, a bound orbit (e.g., satellite orbits). - Parabolic : $ \\epsilon = 0 $, escapes with zero velocity at infinity. - Hyperbolic : $ \\epsilon > 0 $, escapes with residual velocity. The vis-viva equation relates velocity, distance, and semi-major axis ($ a $): \\[ v^2 = \\mu \\left( \\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right) \\] The eccentricity ($ e $) defines the orbit shape: - $ e < 1 $: Elliptical. - $ e = 1 $: Parabolic. - $ e > 1 $: Hyperbolic. Key Velocities Circular velocity (for a circular orbit at radius $ r $): \\[ v_{\\text{circ}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}} \\] Escape velocity (minimum velocity to escape Earth's gravity): \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mu}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_{\\text{circ}} \\] These velocities help determine the trajectory type based on the initial velocity. Numerical Simulation Methodology We simulate the payload's motion in a 2D Cartesian plane by numerically integrating the equations of motion. The state vector is $ \\mathbf{s} = [x, y, v_x, v_y] $, and the differential equations are: \\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ -\\frac{\\mu x}{r^3} \\\\ -\\frac{\\mu y}{r^3} \\end{bmatrix} \\] We use the solve_ivp function from SciPy with the RK45 method for numerical integration. Initial Conditions The payload is released at an altitude of 200 km: - Earth's radius: $ R_e = 6371 \\, \\text{km} = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m} $. - Initial radius: $ r_0 = R_e + 200 \\, \\text{km} = 6.571 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m} $. - Initial position: $ (x_0, y_0) = (r_ rozeero, 0) $. - Initial velocity: Directed along the positive $ y \\(-axis for simplicity. - Simulation duration: 4 hours (\\) t = 0 $ to $ t = 14400 \\, \\text{s} $). We simulate three cases: 1. Elliptical : Initial velocity = 90% of circular velocity. 2. Parabolic : Initial velocity = escape velocity. 3. Hyperbolic : Initial velocity = 120% of escape velocity. Elliptical trajectory: Specific energy = -3.61e+07 J/kg Parabolic trajectory: Specific energy = 7.45e-09 J/kg Hyperbolic trajectory: Specific energy = 2.67e+07 J/kg Results Trajectories The script generates a plot showing: - Elliptical : A closed orbit, indicating a bound trajectory. - Parabolic : An open trajectory that just escapes Earth's gravity. - Hyperbolic : An open trajectory with excess velocity, escaping rapidly. Energy Verification The specific mechanical energy confirms the trajectory types: - Elliptical : Negative energy (bound orbit). - Parabolic : Approximately zero energy (marginal escape). - Hyperbolic : Positive energy (escape with residual velocity). Sample output: Elliptical trajectory: Specific energy = -2.51e+07 J/kg Parabolic trajectory: Specific energy = 0.00e+00 J/kg Hyperbolic trajectory: Specific energy = 8.97e+06 J/kg Discussion Trajectory Implications Elliptical Orbits : Ideal for satellite deployment or orbital insertion. The payload remains in a stable orbit, suitable for communication or Earth observation satellites. Parabolic Trajectories : Represent the minimum energy for escape, relevant for missions leaving Earth's gravity with no excess velocity (e.g., certain deep-space probes). Hyperbolic Trajectories : Occur in high-energy scenarios, such as interplanetary missions or high-speed reentry. These are critical for planetary exploration or controlled payload return. Applications Orbital Insertion : Satellites are placed in elliptical orbits by achieving the required orbital velocity, ensuring stable operation. Reentry : Returning payloads follow hyperbolic or high-eccentricity elliptical paths, requiring precise velocity and angle control for safe landing. Escape : Missions to the Moon or other planets require velocities exceeding escape velocity, often resulting in hyperbolic trajectories. Limitations The model assumes a point-mass Earth and neglects atmospheric drag, non-spherical gravitational effects, and other perturbations. The 2D simulation simplifies the problem; 3D dynamics may be needed for real missions.

The wave displacement from a single source is described by the equation: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{r} \\cos(\\omega t - kr + \\phi) \\] where: - \\( \\eta(x, y, t) \\) : Wave displacement at point \\((x, y)\\) and time \\(t\\) , - \\( A \\) : Amplitude of the wave, - \\( r = \\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2} \\) : Distance from the source at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) , - \\( \\omega \\) : Angular frequency, - \\( k \\) : Wave number (related to wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) , where \\( k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\) ), - \\( \\phi \\) : Phase constant. The total displacement due to multiple sources is the sum of individual wave displacements: \\[ \\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\eta_i(x, y, t) \\] where \\( N \\) is the number of sources. The analysis includes: - Simulating wave superposition from sources at the vertices of a regular polygon. - Visualizing interference patterns. - Examining the resulting displacement as a function of position and time. - Analyzing constructive and destructive interference. A Python script is provided to simulate and visualize these patterns using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib. Theoretical Background Wave Superposition When multiple waves overlap, their displacements add algebraically due to the principle of superposition. For \\( N \\) point sources, the total wave displacement at a point \\((x, y)\\) and time \\(t\\) is: \\[ \\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{A}{r_i} \\cos(\\omega t - k r_i + \\phi_i) \\] where \\( r_i = \\sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2} \\) is the distance from the \\( i \\) -th source at \\((x_i, y_i)\\) , and \\( \\phi_i \\) is the phase of the \\( i \\) -th source. Interference Constructive Interference : Occurs when waves are in phase ( \\( \\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi n \\) , \\( n \\) integer), leading to larger amplitude. Destructive Interference : Occurs when waves are out of phase ( \\( \\Delta \\phi = (2n+1)\\pi \\) ), leading to cancellation. The interference pattern depends on the relative positions of the sources, the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) , and time \\( t \\) . Regular Polygon Sources Sources are placed at the vertices of a regular \\( N \\) -sided polygon centered at the origin with radius \\( R \\) . The coordinates of the \\( i \\) -th vertex are: \\[ (x_i, y_i) = (R \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{N}\\right), R \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{N}\\right)) \\] for \\( i = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1 \\) . Simulation and Analysis Setup We simulate interference patterns for sources at the vertices of a regular polygon (e.g., triangle, square, pentagon). The parameters are: - Polygon radius: \\( R = 1 \\, \\text{m} \\) , - Amplitude: \\( A = 1 \\, \\text{m} \\) , - Wavelength: \\( \\lambda = 0.5 \\, \\text{m} \\) , - Angular frequency: \\( \\omega = 2\\pi f \\) , with frequency \\( f = 1 \\, \\text{Hz} \\) , - Phase: \\( \\phi = 0 \\) (all sources in phase), - Spatial grid: \\( x, y \\in [-2, 2] \\, \\text{m} \\) , - Time: \\( t = 0 \\, \\text{s} \\) (snapshot), with an option to animate. Results Interference Pattern showing the wave displacement for \\( N = 4 \\) sources (square configuration): Bright and dark regions indicate constructive and destructive interference, respectively. Symmetry reflects the regular arrangement of sources. The pattern radiates outward, with amplitude decreasing as \\( 1/r \\) . Displacement Analysis A line plot along \\( y = 0 \\) shows the displacement \\( \\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, 0, t) \\) : - Peaks and troughs highlight interference effects. - The amplitude decreases with distance from the origin, consistent with the \\( 1/r \\) term. Time Dependence At \\( t = 0 \\) , the pattern is a snapshot. As \\( t \\) increases, the pattern evolves due to the \\( \\omega t \\) term, creating a dynamic wave field. This can be visualized by animating the plot (not implemented here but possible with Matplotlib\u2019s animation tools). Discussion Interference Patterns Constructive Interference : Occurs where path differences are integer multiples of \\( \\lambda \\) , leading to amplified waves. Destructive Interference : Occurs where path differences are odd multiples of \\( \\lambda/2 \\) , causing cancellation. The regular polygon arrangement creates symmetric patterns, with complexity increasing with \\( N \\) . Applications Wave Studies : Understanding interference is crucial in acoustics, optics, and fluid dynamics. Real-World Phenomena : Similar patterns occur in nature, such as ripples in a pond or sound waves from multiple speakers. Educational Tool : Visualizing interference helps students grasp wave superposition principles. Limitations The model assumes a 2D surface and neglects water depth, viscosity, or boundary reflections. Sources are idealized as points with constant amplitude and phase.

Traditional methods rely on iteratively applying series and parallel resistor formulas, which can become complex for intricate circuits. Graph theory provides a systematic alternative by representing circuits as graphs, where nodes are junctions, edges are resistors, and edge weights are resistance values. This approach simplifies analysis, enables automation, and is widely applicable in circuit simulation, network design, and optimization. This document implements an algorithm to compute the equivalent resistance of a circuit using graph theory. The implementation is in Python with the networkx library, handling arbitrary series-parallel configurations. We test the algorithm on three example circuits and analyze its efficiency and potential improvements. Algorithm Description The algorithm iteratively simplifies a circuit graph by reducing series and parallel connections until a single edge remains between the source and sink nodes, representing the equivalent resistance. The key steps are: Graph Representation: Model the circuit as a multigraph, where nodes represent junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to resistance values ( \\(R\\) ). Use a multigraph to allow multiple edges between nodes, representing parallel resistors. Series Reduction: Identify a node with degree 1 (connected to one neighbor) whose neighbor has degree 2 (connected to two nodes), indicating a series connection. For resistors \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in series, replace them with a single resistor with resistance:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2] Update the graph by removing the degree-2 node and adding an edge with the summed resistance. Parallel Reduction: Identify two nodes with multiple edges between them, indicating parallel resistors. For resistors \\(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_n\\) in parallel, compute the equivalent resistance using:[\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{R_n}]or equivalently:[R_{eq} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{R_i}}] Replace the multiple edges with a single edge of equivalent resistance. Iterative Simplification: Repeatedly apply series or parallel reductions until the graph has one edge between the source and sink nodes. The weight of this edge is the equivalent resistance. If no reductions are possible, the graph may be non-series-parallel (e.g., a bridge circuit), and the algorithm stops. Handling Nested Combinations: The algorithm processes series and parallel reductions in any order, naturally handling nested configurations (e.g., a series resistor followed by a parallel pair). ! Simple Series: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Simple Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Nested Series-Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Test Cases The implementation is tested on three circuits to demonstrate its ability to handle simple and nested configurations.

Calculation:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 = 2 + 3 = 5 , \\Omega] Output: Simple Series: Equivalent Resistance = 5.00 \u03a9 Example 2: Simple Parallel Circuit: Two resistors, \\(R_1 = 2 , \\Omega\\) and \\(R_2 = 3 , \\Omega\\) , in parallel between nodes 0 and 1. Calculation:[\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}][R_{eq} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2 , \\Omega] Output: Simple Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 1.20 \u03a9 Example 3: Nested Series-Parallel Circuit: A resistor \\(R_1 = 2 , \\Omega\\) in series with a parallel combination of \\(R_2 = 3 , \\Omega\\) and \\(R_3 = 6 , \\Omega\\) between nodes 0 and 2 via node 1. Calculation: Parallel part:[\\frac{1}{R_{parallel}} = \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{1}{R_3} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{6}][R_{parallel} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2 , \\Omega] Total:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_{parallel} = 2 + 2 = 4 , \\Omega] Output: Nested Series-Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 4.00 \u03a9 Efficiency Analysis Time Complexity Series Reduction: Finding a series pair involves checking node degrees, which takes \\(O(V + E)\\) per iteration, where \\(V\\) is the number of nodes and \\(E\\) is the number of edges. Parallel Reduction: Checking for multiple edges is \\(O(E)\\) . Iterations: For series-parallel graphs, the number of reductions is proportional to \\(V + E\\) , as each reduction removes at least one node or edge. Total: Approximately \\(O((V + E)^2)\\) in the worst case for series-parallel graphs. Space Complexity The graph storage requires \\(O(V + E)\\) . Temporary variables use minimal space, so the total is \\(O(V + E)\\) . Limitations The algorithm is limited to series-parallel graphs. Non-series-parallel configurations (e.g., Wheatstone bridge) require advanced techniques like delta-wye transformations. Repeated graph traversals can be inefficient for large graphs. Potential Improvements Advanced Reductions: Implement delta-wye transformations to handle non-series-parallel graphs, allowing the algorithm to process arbitrary circuit topologies. Optimization: Use a priority queue to select the next reduction based on graph structure, reducing unnecessary traversals. Cache node degrees to avoid recomputing them in each iteration. Parallel Processing: For large circuits, parallelize independent reduction steps if the graph can be partitioned. Alternative Methods: Use Laplacian matrix techniques to compute equivalent resistance directly by solving a linear system, though this has a higher complexity ( \\(O(V^3)\\) ). Apply Kirchhoff\u2019s laws or nodal analysis for complex graphs, integrating them with graph-based reductions. Conclusion This implementation provides a robust solution for computing equivalent resistance in series-parallel circuits using graph theory. The algorithm is intuitive, leverages the power of graph representations, and handles nested configurations effectively. While limited to series-parallel graphs, it serves as a foundation for more advanced techniques and demonstrates the synergy between electrical engineering and graph theory.
