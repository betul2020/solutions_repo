Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic problem in mechanics that describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, neglecting air resistance initially. Let\u2019s derive the governing equations from Newton\u2019s second law and establish the family of solutions based on initial conditions. Derivation of Equations of Motion Consider a projectile launched from the origin \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. The only force acting is gravity, with acceleration \\(g\\) downward. We break the motion into horizontal ( \\(x\\) ) and vertical ( \\(y\\) ) components. Horizontal motion : No acceleration, so: $$ a_x = 0 $$ Initial velocity: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) Position: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion : Acceleration due to gravity, \\(a_y = -g\\) : Initial velocity: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Velocity: $$ v_y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Position: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ These are parametric equations describing a parabolic trajectory. The family of solutions depends on the free parameters: \\(v_0\\) (initial speed), \\(\\theta\\) (angle of projection), and \\(g\\) (gravitational acceleration). Varying these parameters generates different trajectories. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . Set \\(y(t) = 0\\) and solve for time of flight \\(t_f\\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factorize: \\[ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 \\] Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) (landing) Substitute \\(t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] Dependence on Angle \\(\\theta\\) Range \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) , i.e., \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , so \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . \\(R = 0\\) when \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) (no horizontal motion).

Air resistance : Introduce a drag term, e.g., \\(-k v\\) , requiring numerical solutions. 4. Implementation Below is a Python script using NumPy and Matplotlib to simulate and visualize the range as a function of \\(\\theta\\) for different \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) . Discussion on Model Constrains The basic model assumes: Absence of air friction: In reality, projectiles lose speed, which decreases their travel distance.

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) . Implications in Astronomy Mass Determination: Measure \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) of a satellite or moon to calculate \\(M\\) of the central body. Distance Calculation: Known \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) yield \\(r\\) , aiding in mapping planetary systems.

Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities Motivation Escape velocity defines the speed needed to break free from a gravitational field, while cosmic velocities extend this to orbiting and escaping larger systems, critical for space exploration. Definitions and Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): Speed for a circular orbit at radius \\(r\\) : \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\) Derived from balancing gravitational and centripetal forces. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): Speed to escape from radius \\(r\\) to infinity: Energy: \\(\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{G M m}{r}\\) \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_1\\) Third Cosmic Velocity: Speed to escape a star system (e.g., Earth escaping the Sun from its orbit). Approximate as escape from Sun\u2019s field at 1 AU: \\(v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{r_{\\text{AU}}}} \\approx 42.1\\) km/s (from Earth\u2019s orbit). Adjusted for Earth\u2019s motion: \\(v_3 \\approx 16.6\\) km/s relative to Earth. Parameters \\(M\\) : Mass of the body \\(r\\) : Distance from center \\(G\\) : Constant Calculations Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, \\(r = 6,371\\) km: \\(v_1 = 7.9\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 11.2\\) km/s Mars: \\(M = 6.417 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, \\(r = 3,390\\) km: \\(v_1 = 3.6\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 5.0\\) km/s Jupiter: \\(M = 1.898 \\times 10^{27}\\) kg, \\(r = 69,911\\) km: \\(v_1 = 42.1\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 59.5\\) km/s Importance in Space Exploration Satellites: \\(v_1\\) for low Earth orbit (LEO). Planetary Missions: \\(v_2\\) to leave Earth; \\(v_3\\) for solar system escape (e.g., Voyager). Problem 3: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth Motivation A payload released from a rocket follows a trajectory shaped by initial velocity and Earth\u2019s gravity, key to mission design. Possible Trajectories Elliptical: If \\(v < v_2\\) , orbits Earth. Parabolic: If \\(v = v_2\\) , escapes to infinity with zero residual speed. Hyperbolic: If \\(v > v_2\\) , escapes with excess speed. Numerical Analysis Use Newton\u2019s gravitation: \\(\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{G M}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\\) .

Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) .

Extending this concept, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the thresholds for orbiting, escaping, and leaving a star system. These principles underpin modern space exploration, from launching satellites to interplanetary missions. Task Definitions and Physical Meaning First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): The minimum speed required for an object to maintain a stable orbit around a celestial body without falling back or drifting away. For a circular orbit, it depends on the body's mass and the orbital radius. Physically, it balances gravitational pull with centrifugal force. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): The speed needed for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a celestial body entirely, reaching infinity with zero kinetic energy. It is the threshold to break free from the body's gravity. Third Cosmic Velocity (Escape from Star System): The speed required to escape the gravitational pull of a star system (e.g., the Solar System), considering the mass of the star and the distance from it. This applies to interstellar travel. 2. Mathematical Derivations and Parameters The velocities can be derived using gravitational principles. Let\u2019s denote: \\(G\\) = Gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} , \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2}\\) ) \\(M\\) = Mass of the celestial body (kg) \\(R\\) = Radius of the orbit or body (m) \\(m\\) = Mass of the object (kg, often cancels out) First Cosmic Velocity For a circular orbit: $ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} $ This arises from equating gravitational force to centripetal force: $ \\frac{GMm}{R^2} = \\frac{mv_1^2}{R} $. Second Cosmic Velocity Escape velocity is derived from conservation of energy, setting total energy to zero at infinity: $ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} $ Third Cosmic Velocity To escape the Solar System, consider the Sun's mass ( \\(M_\\sun = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} , \\text{kg}\\) ) and the distance from the Sun (e.g., Earth's orbital radius \\(R_\\text{Earth} = 1.496 \\times 10^{11} , \\text{m}\\) ): $ v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_\\sun}{R_\\text{Earth}}} $ Calculations and Visualizations Below is a Python script to calculate and visualize the velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter.

Plasma Confinement (e.g., Tokamaks): Crossed electric and magnetic fields confine charged particles in fusion devices. Astrophysical Phenomena: Charged particles in Earth's magnetosphere follow helical paths due to the planet's magnetic field.

Simulate Particle Motion We simulate the motion of a charged particle using Python. The equation of motion is derived from Newton's second law: $$ \\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} = m \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} $$ Substituting the Lorentz force: $$ m \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = q\\mathbf{E} + q\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} $$ We also have the kinematic relation: $$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \\mathbf{v} $$ where $ \\mathbf{r} $ is the position of the particle. We solve these differential equations numerically using the Runge-Kutta 4th-order (RK4) method for better accuracy compared to the Euler method.

Traditional methods rely on iteratively applying series and parallel resistor formulas, which can become complex for intricate circuits. Graph theory provides a systematic alternative by representing circuits as graphs, where nodes are junctions, edges are resistors, and edge weights are resistance values. This approach simplifies analysis, enables automation, and is widely applicable in circuit simulation, network design, and optimization. This document implements an algorithm to compute the equivalent resistance of a circuit using graph theory. The implementation is in Python with the networkx library, handling arbitrary series-parallel configurations. We test the algorithm on three example circuits and analyze its efficiency and potential improvements. Algorithm Description The algorithm iteratively simplifies a circuit graph by reducing series and parallel connections until a single edge remains between the source and sink nodes, representing the equivalent resistance. The key steps are: Graph Representation: Model the circuit as a multigraph, where nodes represent junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to resistance values ( \\(R\\) ). Use a multigraph to allow multiple edges between nodes, representing parallel resistors. Series Reduction: Identify a node with degree 1 (connected to one neighbor) whose neighbor has degree 2 (connected to two nodes), indicating a series connection. For resistors \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in series, replace them with a single resistor with resistance:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2] Update the graph by removing the degree-2 node and adding an edge with the summed resistance. Parallel Reduction: Identify two nodes with multiple edges between them, indicating parallel resistors. For resistors \\(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_n\\) in parallel, compute the equivalent resistance using:[\\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{R_n}]or equivalently:[R_{eq} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{R_i}}] Replace the multiple edges with a single edge of equivalent resistance. Iterative Simplification: Repeatedly apply series or parallel reductions until the graph has one edge between the source and sink nodes. The weight of this edge is the equivalent resistance. If no reductions are possible, the graph may be non-series-parallel (e.g., a bridge circuit), and the algorithm stops. Handling Nested Combinations: The algorithm processes series and parallel reductions in any order, naturally handling nested configurations (e.g., a series resistor followed by a parallel pair). !

This task explores two methods to estimate \\(\\pi\\) : Circle-Based Monte Carlo Method: Using the ratio of points inside a circle to points in a square. Buffon's Needle Method: Simulating needle drops to estimate \\(\\pi\\) based on the probability of crossing parallel lines. These methods bridge probability, geometry, and numerical computation, providing practical insights into convergence rates and computational efficiency. Theoretical Foundation Circle-Based Monte Carlo Method Consider a unit circle (radius 1) centered at the origin, inscribed in a square with side length 2 (spanning \\(x, y \\in [-1, 1]\\) ). The area of the circle is \\(\\pi \\cdot 1^2 = \\pi\\) , and the area of the square is \\(2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\) . The ratio of these areas is: [ \\frac{\\text{Area of circle}}{\\text{Area of square}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} ] If we randomly generate points in the square, the probability a point lies inside the circle (i.e., \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\) ) equals this ratio. Thus: [ \\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Number of points inside circle}}{\\text{Total number of points}} ] Buffon's Needle Method In Buffon's Needle problem, a needle of length \\(l\\) is dropped onto a plane with parallel lines spaced \\(d\\) units apart, where \\(l \\leq d\\) . The probability that the needle crosses a line depends on its position and orientation. The position of the needle's center is uniformly distributed between 0 and \\(d\\) , and its angle \\(\\theta\\) relative to the lines is uniformly distributed between 0 and \\(\\pi\\) . The distance from the needle\u2019s center to the nearest line is \\(y \\in [0, \\frac{d}{2}]\\) , and the needle crosses a line if \\(y \\leq \\frac{l}{2} \\sin(\\theta)\\) . The probability of crossing is derived as: [ P(\\text{crossing}) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{l}{d} ] For \\(l = d\\) , this simplifies to \\(P = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\) . Thus: [ \\pi \\approx \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{Number of throws}}{\\text{Number of crossings}} ] Simulation and Visualization Circle-Based Monte Carlo Simulation We generate random points in a 2D square and count how many fall inside the unit circle, then estimate \\(\\pi\\) . The simulation is visualized by plotting the points, distinguishing those inside and outside the circle. Buffon's Needle Simulation We simulate dropping a needle on a plane with parallel lines, count the crossings, and estimate \\(\\pi\\) . The needle positions are visualized relative to the lines.

This task explores two methods to estimate \\(\\pi\\) : Circle-Based Monte Carlo Method: Using the ratio of points inside a circle to points in a square. Buffon's Needle Method: Simulating needle drops to estimate \\(\\pi\\) based on the probability of crossing parallel lines. These methods bridge probability, geometry, and numerical computation, providing practical insights into convergence rates and computational efficiency. Theoretical Foundation Circle-Based Monte Carlo Method Consider a unit circle (radius 1) centered at the origin, inscribed in a square with side length 2 (spanning \\(x, y \\in [-1, 1]\\) ). The area of the circle is \\(\\pi \\cdot 1^2 = \\pi\\) , and the area of the square is \\(2 \\cdot 2 = 4\\) . The ratio of these areas is: [ \\frac{\\text{Area of circle}}{\\text{Area of square}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} ] If we randomly generate points in the square, the probability a point lies inside the circle (i.e., \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\) ) equals this ratio. Thus: [ \\pi \\approx 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Number of points inside circle}}{\\text{Total number of points}} ] Buffon's Needle Method In Buffon's Needle problem, a needle of length \\(l\\) is dropped onto a plane with parallel lines spaced \\(d\\) units apart, where \\(l \\leq d\\) . The probability that the needle crosses a line depends on its position and orientation. The position of the needle's center is uniformly distributed between 0 and \\(d\\) , and its angle \\(\\theta\\) relative to the lines is uniformly distributed between 0 and \\(\\pi\\) . The distance from the needle\u2019s center to the nearest line is \\(y \\in [0, \\frac{d}{2}]\\) , and the needle crosses a line if \\(y \\leq \\frac{l}{2} \\sin(\\theta)\\) . The probability of crossing is derived as: [ P(\\text{crossing}) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{l}{d} ] For \\(l = d\\) , this simplifies to \\(P = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\) . Thus: [ \\pi \\approx \\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{Number of throws}}{\\text{Number of crossings}} ] Simulation and Visualization Circle-Based Monte Carlo Simulation We generate random points in a 2D square and count how many fall inside the unit circle, then estimate \\(\\pi\\) . The simulation is visualized by plotting the points, distinguishing those inside and outside the circle. Buffon's Needle Simulation We simulate dropping a needle on a plane with parallel lines, count the crossings, and estimate \\(\\pi\\) . The needle positions are visualized relative to the lines.
