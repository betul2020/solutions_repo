Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic problem in mechanics that describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, neglecting air resistance initially. Let\u2019s derive the governing equations from Newton\u2019s second law and establish the family of solutions based on initial conditions. Derivation of Equations of Motion Consider a projectile launched from the origin \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. The only force acting is gravity, with acceleration \\(g\\) downward. We break the motion into horizontal ( \\(x\\) ) and vertical ( \\(y\\) ) components. Horizontal motion : No acceleration, so: $$ a_x = 0 $$ Initial velocity: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) Position: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion : Acceleration due to gravity, \\(a_y = -g\\) : Initial velocity: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Velocity: $$ v_y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Position: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ These are parametric equations describing a parabolic trajectory. The family of solutions depends on the free parameters: \\(v_0\\) (initial speed), \\(\\theta\\) (angle of projection), and \\(g\\) (gravitational acceleration). Varying these parameters generates different trajectories. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . Set \\(y(t) = 0\\) and solve for time of flight \\(t_f\\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factorize: \\[ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 \\] Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) (landing) Substitute \\(t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] Dependence on Angle \\(\\theta\\) Range \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) , i.e., \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , so \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . \\(R = 0\\) when \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) (no horizontal motion).

Air resistance : Introduce a drag term, e.g., \\(-k v\\) , requiring numerical solutions. 4. Implementation Below is a Python script using NumPy and Matplotlib to simulate and visualize the range as a function of \\(\\theta\\) for different \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) . Discussion on Model Constrains The basic model assumes: Absence of air friction: In reality, projectiles lose speed, which decreases their travel distance.

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) . Implications in Astronomy Mass Determination: Measure \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) of a satellite or moon to calculate \\(M\\) of the central body.

Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities Motivation Escape velocity defines the speed needed to break free from a gravitational field, while cosmic velocities extend this to orbiting and escaping larger systems, critical for space exploration. Definitions and Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): Speed for a circular orbit at radius \\(r\\) : \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\) Derived from balancing gravitational and centripetal forces. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): Speed to escape from radius \\(r\\) to infinity: Energy: \\(\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{G M m}{r}\\) \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_1\\) Third Cosmic Velocity: Speed to escape a star system (e.g., Earth escaping the Sun from its orbit). Approximate as escape from Sun\u2019s field at 1 AU: \\(v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{r_{\\text{AU}}}} \\approx 42.1\\) km/s (from Earth\u2019s orbit). Adjusted for Earth\u2019s motion: \\(v_3 \\approx 16.6\\) km/s relative to Earth. Parameters \\(M\\) : Mass of the body \\(r\\) : Distance from center \\(G\\) : Constant Calculations Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, \\(r = 6,371\\) km: \\(v_1 = 7.9\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 11.2\\) km/s Mars: \\(M = 6.417 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, \\(r = 3,390\\) km: \\(v_1 = 3.6\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 5.0\\) km/s Jupiter: \\(M = 1.898 \\times 10^{27}\\) kg, \\(r = 69,911\\) km: \\(v_1 = 42.1\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 59.5\\) km/s Importance in Space Exploration Satellites: \\(v_1\\) for low Earth orbit (LEO). Planetary Missions: \\(v_2\\) to leave Earth; \\(v_3\\) for solar system escape (e.g., Voyager). Problem 3: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth Motivation A payload released from a rocket follows a trajectory shaped by initial velocity and Earth\u2019s gravity, key to mission design. Possible Trajectories Elliptical: If \\(v < v_2\\) , orbits Earth. Parabolic: If \\(v = v_2\\) , escapes to infinity with zero residual speed. Hyperbolic: If \\(v > v_2\\) , escapes with excess speed. Numerical Analysis Use Newton\u2019s gravitation: \\(\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{G M}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\\) .

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) .

Definitions and Physical Meaning First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) The first cosmic velocity is the minimum speed required for an object to maintain a circular orbit around a celestial body at a given radius (typically near the surface). It represents the balance between gravitational attraction and centripetal force needed for orbital motion. Physical Meaning: Achieving \\(v_1\\) allows satellites to orbit without falling back to the surface or escaping into space. Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ) The second cosmic velocity, or escape velocity, is the speed required for an object to escape a celestial body\u2019s gravitational field entirely, reaching infinity with zero residual velocity. Physical Meaning: \\(v_2\\) enables spacecraft to leave a planet\u2019s influence, critical for interplanetary missions. Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ) The third cosmic velocity is the speed required for an object to escape the gravitational influence of a star system (e.g., the Sun) from the orbit of a planet (e.g., Earth).

The study includes: - Classification of possible trajectories (elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic) based on initial conditions. - Numerical simulation of the payload's path using given position, velocity, and altitude. - Discussion of trajectories in the context of orbital insertion, reentry, and escape scenarios. - Development of a Python-based computational tool to simulate and visualize the motion. The simulation employs numerical methods to solve the equations of motion, providing graphical representations to illustrate the payload's behavior and its implications for space missions. Theoretical Framework Gravitational Dynamics The motion of the payload is governed by Newton's Law of Gravitation : \\[ F = -\\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] where: - $ G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} $ is the gravitational constant, - $ M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} $ is Earth's mass, - $ m $ is the payload's mass, - $ r $ is the distance from Earth's center to the payload, - $ \\hat{r} $ is the radial unit vector. The acceleration in Cartesian coordinates \\((x, y)\\) is: \\[ \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{\\mu}{r^3} \\mathbf{r} \\] where $ \\mathbf{r} = (x, y) $, $ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} $, and $ \\mu = G M = 3.986 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{s}^{-2} $ is Earth's gravitational parameter. Trajectory Classification The trajectory is determined by the specific mechanical energy ($ \\epsilon $): \\[ \\epsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\] where $ v $ is the payload's speed. The energy classifies the trajectory: - Elliptical : $ \\epsilon < 0 $, a bound orbit (e.g., satellite orbits). - Parabolic : $ \\epsilon = 0 $, escapes with zero velocity at infinity. - Hyperbolic : $ \\epsilon > 0 $, escapes with residual velocity. The vis-viva equation relates velocity, distance, and semi-major axis ($ a $): \\[ v^2 = \\mu \\left( \\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right) \\] The eccentricity ($ e $) defines the orbit shape: - $ e < 1 $: Elliptical. - $ e = 1 $: Parabolic. - $ e > 1 $: Hyperbolic. Key Velocities Circular velocity (for a circular orbit at radius $ r $): \\[ v_{\\text{circ}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r}} \\] Escape velocity (minimum velocity to escape Earth's gravity): \\[ v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\mu}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_{\\text{circ}} \\] These velocities help determine the trajectory type based on the initial velocity. Numerical Simulation Methodology We simulate the payload's motion in a 2D Cartesian plane by numerically integrating the equations of motion. The state vector is $ \\mathbf{s} = [x, y, v_x, v_y] $, and the differential equations are: \\[ \\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ -\\frac{\\mu x}{r^3} \\\\ -\\frac{\\mu y}{r^3} \\end{bmatrix} \\] We use the solve_ivp function from SciPy with the RK45 method for numerical integration. Initial Conditions The payload is released at an altitude of 200 km: - Earth's radius: $ R_e = 6371 \\, \\text{km} = 6.371 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m} $. - Initial radius: $ r_0 = R_e + 200 \\, \\text{km} = 6.571 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{m} $. - Initial position: $ (x_0, y_0) = (r_ rozeero, 0) $. - Initial velocity: Directed along the positive $ y \\(-axis for simplicity. - Simulation duration: 4 hours (\\) t = 0 $ to $ t = 14400 \\, \\text{s} $). We simulate three cases: 1. Elliptical : Initial velocity = 90% of circular velocity. 2. Parabolic : Initial velocity = escape velocity. 3. Hyperbolic : Initial velocity = 120% of escape velocity. Elliptical trajectory: Specific energy = -3.61e+07 J/kg Parabolic trajectory: Specific energy = 7.45e-09 J/kg Hyperbolic trajectory: Specific energy = 2.67e+07 J/kg Results Trajectories The script generates a plot showing: - Elliptical : A closed orbit, indicating a bound trajectory. - Parabolic : An open trajectory that just escapes Earth's gravity. - Hyperbolic : An open trajectory with excess velocity, escaping rapidly. Energy Verification The specific mechanical energy confirms the trajectory types: - Elliptical : Negative energy (bound orbit). - Parabolic : Approximately zero energy (marginal escape). - Hyperbolic : Positive energy (escape with residual velocity). Sample output: Elliptical trajectory: Specific energy = -2.51e+07 J/kg Parabolic trajectory: Specific energy = 0.00e+00 J/kg Hyperbolic trajectory: Specific energy = 8.97e+06 J/kg Discussion Trajectory Implications Elliptical Orbits : Ideal for satellite deployment or orbital insertion. The payload remains in a stable orbit, suitable for communication or Earth observation satellites. Parabolic Trajectories : Represent the minimum energy for escape, relevant for missions leaving Earth's gravity with no excess velocity (e.g., certain deep-space probes). Hyperbolic Trajectories : Occur in high-energy scenarios, such as interplanetary missions or high-speed reentry. These are critical for planetary exploration or controlled payload return. Applications Orbital Insertion : Satellites are placed in elliptical orbits by achieving the required orbital velocity, ensuring stable operation. Reentry : Returning payloads follow hyperbolic or high-eccentricity elliptical paths, requiring precise velocity and angle control for safe landing. Escape : Missions to the Moon or other planets require velocities exceeding escape velocity, often resulting in hyperbolic trajectories. Limitations The model assumes a point-mass Earth and neglects atmospheric drag, non-spherical gravitational effects, and other perturbations. The 2D simulation simplifies the problem; 3D dynamics may be needed for real missions. Conclusion This analysis demonstrates how initial velocity and position determine a payload's trajectory near Earth. The numerical simulation provides a clear visualization of elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic paths, with applications in space mission planning, satellite deployment, and planetary exploration. The Python tool can be extended to include additional forces (e.g., drag, solar radiation) or 3D dynamics for more accurate modeling.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#analysis-of-payload-trajectories-near-earth","text":"","title":"Analysis of Payload Trajectories Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#introduction","text":"This document analyzes the trajectories of a payload released from a moving rocket near Earth, under the influence of Earth's gravitational field.
