Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic problem in mechanics that describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, neglecting air resistance initially. Let\u2019s derive the governing equations from Newton\u2019s second law and establish the family of solutions based on initial conditions. Derivation of Equations of Motion Consider a projectile launched from the origin \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. The only force acting is gravity, with acceleration \\(g\\) downward. We break the motion into horizontal ( \\(x\\) ) and vertical ( \\(y\\) ) components. Horizontal motion : No acceleration, so: $$ a_x = 0 $$ Initial velocity: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) Position: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion : Acceleration due to gravity, \\(a_y = -g\\) : Initial velocity: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Velocity: $$ v_y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Position: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ These are parametric equations describing a parabolic trajectory. The family of solutions depends on the free parameters: \\(v_0\\) (initial speed), \\(\\theta\\) (angle of projection), and \\(g\\) (gravitational acceleration). Varying these parameters generates different trajectories. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . Set \\(y(t) = 0\\) and solve for time of flight \\(t_f\\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factorize: \\[ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 \\] Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) (landing) Substitute \\(t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] Dependence on Angle \\(\\theta\\) Range \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) , i.e., \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , so \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . \\(R = 0\\) when \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) (no horizontal motion).

Air resistance : Introduce a drag term, e.g., \\(-k v\\) , requiring numerical solutions. 4. Implementation Below is a Python script using NumPy and Matplotlib to simulate and visualize the range as a function of \\(\\theta\\) for different \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) . Discussion on Model Constrains The basic model assumes: Absence of air friction: In reality, projectiles lose speed, which decreases their travel distance.

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) . Implications in Astronomy Mass Determination: Measure \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) of a satellite or moon to calculate \\(M\\) of the central body. Distance Calculation: Known \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) yield \\(r\\) , aiding in mapping planetary systems.

Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities Motivation Escape velocity defines the speed needed to break free from a gravitational field, while cosmic velocities extend this to orbiting and escaping larger systems, critical for space exploration. Definitions and Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): Speed for a circular orbit at radius \\(r\\) : \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\) Derived from balancing gravitational and centripetal forces. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): Speed to escape from radius \\(r\\) to infinity: Energy: \\(\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{G M m}{r}\\) \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_1\\) Third Cosmic Velocity: Speed to escape a star system (e.g., Earth escaping the Sun from its orbit). Approximate as escape from Sun\u2019s field at 1 AU: \\(v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{r_{\\text{AU}}}} \\approx 42.1\\) km/s (from Earth\u2019s orbit). Adjusted for Earth\u2019s motion: \\(v_3 \\approx 16.6\\) km/s relative to Earth. Parameters \\(M\\) : Mass of the body \\(r\\) : Distance from center \\(G\\) : Constant Calculations Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, \\(r = 6,371\\) km: \\(v_1 = 7.9\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 11.2\\) km/s Mars: \\(M = 6.417 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, \\(r = 3,390\\) km: \\(v_1 = 3.6\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 5.0\\) km/s Jupiter: \\(M = 1.898 \\times 10^{27}\\) kg, \\(r = 69,911\\) km: \\(v_1 = 42.1\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 59.5\\) km/s Importance in Space Exploration Satellites: \\(v_1\\) for low Earth orbit (LEO). Planetary Missions: \\(v_2\\) to leave Earth; \\(v_3\\) for solar system escape (e.g., Voyager). Problem 3: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth Motivation A payload released from a rocket follows a trajectory shaped by initial velocity and Earth\u2019s gravity, key to mission design. Possible Trajectories Elliptical: If \\(v < v_2\\) , orbits Earth. Parabolic: If \\(v = v_2\\) , escapes to infinity with zero residual speed. Hyperbolic: If \\(v > v_2\\) , escapes with excess speed. Numerical Analysis Use Newton\u2019s gravitation: \\(\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{G M}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\\) .

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) .

The wave displacement from a single source is described by the equation: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{r} \\cos(\\omega t - kr + \\phi) \\] where: - \\( \\eta(x, y, t) \\) : Wave displacement at point \\((x, y)\\) and time \\(t\\) , - \\( A \\) : Amplitude of the wave, - \\( r = \\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2} \\) : Distance from the source at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) , - \\( \\omega \\) : Angular frequency, - \\( k \\) : Wave number (related to wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) , where \\( k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\) ), - \\( \\phi \\) : Phase constant. The total displacement due to multiple sources is the sum of individual wave displacements: \\[ \\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\eta_i(x, y, t) \\] where \\( N \\) is the number of sources. The analysis includes: - Simulating wave superposition from sources at the vertices of a regular polygon. - Visualizing interference patterns. - Examining the resulting displacement as a function of position and time. - Analyzing constructive and destructive interference. A Python script is provided to simulate and visualize these patterns using libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib. Theoretical Background Wave Superposition When multiple waves overlap, their displacements add algebraically due to the principle of superposition. For \\( N \\) point sources, the total wave displacement at a point \\((x, y)\\) and time \\(t\\) is: \\[ \\eta_{\\text{sum}}(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{A}{r_i} \\cos(\\omega t - k r_i + \\phi_i) \\] where \\( r_i = \\sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2} \\) is the distance from the \\( i \\) -th source at \\((x_i, y_i)\\) , and \\( \\phi_i \\) is the phase of the \\( i \\) -th source. Interference Constructive Interference : Occurs when waves are in phase ( \\( \\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi n \\) , \\( n \\) integer), leading to larger amplitude. Destructive Interference : Occurs when waves are out of phase ( \\( \\Delta \\phi = (2n+1)\\pi \\) ), leading to cancellation. The interference pattern depends on the relative positions of the sources, the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) , and time \\( t \\) . Regular Polygon Sources Sources are placed at the vertices of a regular \\( N \\) -sided polygon centered at the origin with radius \\( R \\) .

It is fundamental in fields like plasma physics, particle accelerators, and astrophysics. By focusing on simulations, we can explore the practical applications and visualize the complex trajectories that arise due to this force. Task Overview Theory and Application : Identify systems where the Lorentz force is key and discuss the roles of electric ( \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) ) and magnetic ( \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) ) fields. Simulating Particle Motion : Simulate the trajectory of a charged particle under various field configurations (uniform magnetic field, combined electric and magnetic fields, crossed fields, and non-uniform magnetic field). Parameter Exploration : Vary parameters like field strengths, initial velocity, charge, and mass to observe their effects. Visualization : Create 2D and 3D plots to visualize the particle\u2019s trajectory and highlight phenomena like Larmor radius and drift velocity. Solution ### Theory and Application Systems Involving the Lorentz Force The Lorentz force plays a critical role in several systems: Particle Accelerators : In cyclotrons, the magnetic field causes charged particles to move in circular paths, while electric fields accelerate them. The Lorentz force ensures particles follow a spiral trajectory as their energy increases. Mass Spectrometers : The Lorentz force separates ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio by deflecting them in a magnetic field. Plasma Confinement : In fusion devices like tokamaks, magnetic fields confine charged particles in a plasma, preventing them from hitting the reactor walls. Role of Electric and Magnetic Fields Electric Field ( \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) ) : Exerts a force \\(\\mathbf{F}_E = q \\mathbf{E}\\) , accelerating the particle in the direction of the field (if \\(q\\) is positive). This force is independent of the particle\u2019s velocity. Magnetic Field ( \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) ) : Exerts a force \\(\\mathbf{F}_B = q (\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B})\\) , which is perpendicular to both the velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) and the magnetic field \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) . This force causes circular or helical motion but does no work since it is always perpendicular to the velocity. Simulating Particle Motion We\u2019ll simulate the motion of a charged particle under the Lorentz force using the following equation of motion: \\[ \\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a} = q (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\] This gives the acceleration: \\[ \\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \\frac{q}{m} (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\] We\u2019ll use the Runge-Kutta 4th-order method (RK4) to numerically solve this differential equation, as it provides better accuracy than the Euler method. We\u2019ll simulate the following cases: Uniform Magnetic Field : \\(\\mathbf{B} = (0, 0, B_z)\\) , \\(\\mathbf{E} = 0\\) . Combined Uniform Electric and Magnetic Fields : \\(\\mathbf{B} = (0, 0, B_z)\\) , \\(\\mathbf{E} = (E_x, 0, 0)\\) . Crossed Fields : \\(\\mathbf{B} = (0, 0, B_z)\\) , \\(\\mathbf{E} = (E_x, 0, 0)\\) , with \\(\\mathbf{E} \\perp \\mathbf{B}\\) . Non-Uniform Magnetic Field (Magnetic Bottle) : \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) varies spatially. Parameter Exploration We\u2019ll explore the effects of varying parameters: Field Strengths : Increase \\(B_z\\) to 2 T. A stronger magnetic field reduces the Larmor radius, as \\(R_L = \\frac{m v_\\perp}{q B}\\) , leading to tighter circular motion. Initial Velocity : Double \\(v_0\\) to \\((2 \\times 10^5, 2 \\times 10^5, 0)\\) m/s. This increases the Larmor radius proportionally, as \\(R_L \\propto v_\\perp\\) . Charge and Mass : Use an electron ( \\(q = -1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\) C, \\(m = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31}\\) kg). The smaller mass and opposite charge result in a smaller Larmor radius and opposite direction of rotation. These variations can be implemented by modifying the constants in the script and re-running the simulation. Visualization The script generates 2D and 3D plots for each case: Uniform Magnetic Field : The particle follows a helical path (circular in the x-y plane) with a Larmor radius of approximately \\(1.04 \\times 10^{-3}\\) m. Combined E and B Fields : The electric field introduces a drift in the x-direction, resulting in a helical path with a drift velocity of \\(1.00 \\times 10^3\\) m/s. Crossed Fields : Similar to the combined case, but the drift is more pronounced due to the perpendicular fields. Magnetic Bottle : The non-uniform field causes the particle to oscillate along the z-axis, demonstrating confinement. Discussion The simulations highlight key phenomena: Larmor Radius : In a uniform magnetic field, the particle\u2019s circular motion has a radius \\(R_L = \\frac{m v_\\perp}{q B}\\) , which matches our calculated value. Drift Velocity : In crossed fields, the \\(\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}\\) drift velocity is \\(v_d = \\frac{E}{B}\\) , consistent with our result. Practical Applications : The helical motion in a magnetic field is seen in cyclotrons, while the drift in crossed fields is used in mass spectrometers. The magnetic bottle simulation demonstrates plasma confinement, as used in fusion research. Conclusion This simulation successfully demonstrates the effects of the Lorentz force on a charged particle under various field configurations. The visualizations reveal circular, helical, and drifting trajectories, aligning with theoretical expectations. By exploring parameter variations, we gain insight into how field strengths, velocity, and particle properties influence motion, providing a deeper understanding of applications like particle accelerators and plasma confinement systems.

Traditional methods rely on iteratively applying series and parallel resistor formulas, which can become complex for intricate circuits. Graph theory provides a systematic alternative by representing circuits as graphs, where nodes are junctions, edges are resistors, and edge weights are resistance values. This approach simplifies analysis, enables automation, and is widely applicable in circuit simulation, network design, and optimization. This document implements an algorithm to compute the equivalent resistance of a circuit using graph theory. The implementation is in Python with the networkx library, handling arbitrary series-parallel configurations. We test the algorithm on three example circuits and analyze its efficiency and potential improvements. Algorithm Description The algorithm iteratively simplifies a circuit graph by reducing series and parallel connections until a single edge remains between the source and sink nodes, representing the equivalent resistance. the key steps are: Graph Representation: Model the circuit as a multigraph, where nodes represent junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to resistance values ( \\(R\\) ). Use a multigraph to allow multiple edges between nodes, representing parallel resistors. Series Reduction: Identify a node with degree 1 (connected to one neighbor) whose neighbor has degree 2 (connected to two nodes), indicating a series connection. For resistors \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in series, replace them with a single resistor with resistance:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2] Update the graph by removing the degree-2 node and adding an edge with the summed resistance. dentify two nodes with multiple edges between them, indicating parallel resistors. For resistors (R_1, R_2, ..., R_n) in parallel, compute the equivalent resistance using: 1/R_eq = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + ... + 1/R_n Replace the multiple edges with a single edge of equivalent resistance. Circuit Two resistors, (R_1 = 2 Ohm) and (R_2 = 3 Ohm), in parallel between nodes 0 and 1. Calculation 1/R_eq = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 = 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6 Ohm^-1 R_eq = 6/5 = 1.2 Ohm Output: Simple Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = (1.20 Ohm) Example 3: Nested Series-Parallel Circuit A resistor (R_1 = 2 Ohm) in series with a parallel combination of (R_2 = 3 Ohm) and (R_3 = 6 Ohm), between nodes 0 and 2 via node 1. Calculation Parallel part: 1/R_parallel = 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 Ohm^-1 R_parallel = 2 Ohm Total: R_total = R_1 + R_parallel = 2 + 2 = 4 Ohm Output : Nested Series-Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = \\( 4.00 \\, \\Omega \\) Iterative Simplification: Repeatedly apply series or parallel reductions until the graph has one edge between the source and sink nodes. The weight of this edge is the equivalent resistance. If no reductions are possible, the graph may be non-series-parallel (e.g., a bridge circuit), and the algorithm stops. Handling Nested Combinations: The algorithm processes series and parallel reductions in any order, naturally handling nested configurations (e.g., a series resistor followed by a parallel pair). ! Simple Series: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Simple Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Nested Series-Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Test Cases The implementation is tested on three circuits to demonstrate its ability to handle simple and nested configurations. Example 1: Simple Series Circuit: Two resistors, \\(R_1 = 2 , \\Omega\\) and \\(R_2 = 3 , \\Omega\\) , in series between nodes 0 and 2 via node 1. Calculation:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 = 2 + 3 = 5 , \\Omega] Output: Simple Series: Equivalent Resistance = 5.00 \u03a9 First Cosmic Velocity For a circular orbit: \\( v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} \\) This arises from equating gravitational force to centripetal force: \\( \\frac{GMm}{R^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{R} \\) Second Cosmic Velocity Escape velocity is derived from conservation of energy, setting total energy to zero at infinity: \\( v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\) Third Cosmic Velocity To escape the Solar System, consider the Sun's mass ( \\( M_{\\text{sun}} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ) and the distance from the Sun (i.e., Earth's orbital radius \\( R \\approx 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m} \\) , \\( M_{\\text{Earth}} = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ): \\[ v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2G(M_{\\text{sun}} + M_{\\text{Earth}})}{R}} \\] Efficiency Analysis Time Complexity Series Reduction: Finding a series pair involves checking node degrees, which takes \\(O(V + E)\\) per iteration, where \\(V\\) is the number of nodes and \\(E\\) is the number of edges. Parallel Reduction: Checking for multiple edges is \\(O(E)\\) . Iterations: For series-parallel graphs, the number of reductions is proportional to \\(V + E\\) , as each reduction removes at least one node or edge. Total: Approximately \\(O((V + E)^2)\\) in the worst case for series-parallel graphs. Space Complexity The graph storage requires \\(O(V + E)\\) . Temporary variables use minimal space, so the total is \\(O(V + E)\\) . Limitations The algorithm is limited to series-parallel graphs. Non-series-parallel configurations (e.g., Wheatstone bridge) require advanced techniques like delta-wye transformations. Repeated graph traversals can be inefficient for large graphs. Potential Improvements Advanced Reductions: Implement delta-wye transformations to handle non-series-parallel graphs, allowing the algorithm to process arbitrary circuit topologies. Optimization: Use a priority queue to select the next reduction based on graph structure, reducing unnecessary traversals. Cache node degrees to avoid recomputing them in each iteration. Parallel Processing: For large circuits, parallelize independent reduction steps if the graph can be partitioned. Alternative Methods: Use Laplacian matrix techniques to compute equivalent resistance directly by solving a linear system, though this has a higher complexity ( \\(O(V^3)\\) ). Apply Kirchhoff\u2019s laws or nodal analysis for complex graphs, integrating them with graph-based reductions. Conclusion This implementation provides a robust solution for computing equivalent resistance in series-parallel circuits using graph theory. The algorithm is intuitive, leverages the power of graph representations, and handles nested configurations effectively. While limited to series-parallel graphs, it serves as a foundation for more advanced techniques and demonstrates the synergy between electrical engineering and graph theory. Future enhancements could include support for non-series-parallel graphs and optimized traversal strategies to improve performance on large-scale circuits.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"Calculating Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory Introduction Calculating the equivalent resistance of a circuit is a fundamental problem in electrical engineering.

This document implements an algorithm to compute the equivalent resistance of a circuit using graph theory. The implementation is in Python with the networkx library, handling arbitrary series-parallel configurations. We test the algorithm on three example circuits and analyze its efficiency and potential improvements. Algorithm Description The algorithm iteratively simplifies a circuit graph by reducing series and parallel connections until a single edge remains between the source and sink nodes, representing the equivalent resistance. the key steps are: Graph Representation: Model the circuit as a multigraph, where nodes represent junctions and edges represent resistors with weights equal to resistance values ( \\(R\\) ). Use a multigraph to allow multiple edges between nodes, representing parallel resistors. Series Reduction: Identify a node with degree 1 (connected to one neighbor) whose neighbor has degree 2 (connected to two nodes), indicating a series connection. For resistors \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in series, replace them with a single resistor with resistance:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2] Update the graph by removing the degree-2 node and adding an edge with the summed resistance. dentify two nodes with multiple edges between them, indicating parallel resistors. For resistors (R_1, R_2, ..., R_n) in parallel, compute the equivalent resistance using: 1/R_eq = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + ... + 1/R_n Replace the multiple edges with a single edge of equivalent resistance. Circuit Two resistors, (R_1 = 2 Ohm) and (R_2 = 3 Ohm), in parallel between nodes 0 and 1. Calculation 1/R_eq = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2 = 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6 Ohm^-1 R_eq = 6/5 = 1.2 Ohm Output: Simple Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = (1.20 Ohm) Example 3: Nested Series-Parallel Circuit A resistor (R_1 = 2 Ohm) in series with a parallel combination of (R_2 = 3 Ohm) and (R_3 = 6 Ohm), between nodes 0 and 2 via node 1. Calculation Parallel part: 1/R_parallel = 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6 Ohm^-1 R_parallel = 2 Ohm Total: R_total = R_1 + R_parallel = 2 + 2 = 4 Ohm Output : Nested Series-Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = \\( 4.00 \\, \\Omega \\) Iterative Simplification: Repeatedly apply series or parallel reductions until the graph has one edge between the source and sink nodes. The weight of this edge is the equivalent resistance. If no reductions are possible, the graph may be non-series-parallel (e.g., a bridge circuit), and the algorithm stops. Handling Nested Combinations: The algorithm processes series and parallel reductions in any order, naturally handling nested configurations (e.g., a series resistor followed by a parallel pair). ! Simple Series: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Simple Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Nested Series-Parallel: Equivalent Resistance = 1.00 \u03a9 Test Cases The implementation is tested on three circuits to demonstrate its ability to handle simple and nested configurations. Example 1: Simple Series Circuit: Two resistors, \\(R_1 = 2 , \\Omega\\) and \\(R_2 = 3 , \\Omega\\) , in series between nodes 0 and 2 via node 1. Calculation:[R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 = 2 + 3 = 5 , \\Omega] Output: Simple Series: Equivalent Resistance = 5.00 \u03a9","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#first-cosmic-velocity","text":"For a circular orbit: \\( v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} \\) This arises from equating gravitational force to centripetal force: \\( \\frac{GMm}{R^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{R} \\)","title":"First Cosmic Velocity"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#second-cosmic-velocity","text":"Escape velocity is derived from conservation of energy, setting total energy to zero at infinity: \\( v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} \\)","title":"Second Cosmic Velocity"},{"location":"1%20Physics/5%20Circuits/Problem_1/#third-cosmic-velocity","text":"To escape the Solar System, consider the Sun's mass ( \\( M_{\\text{sun}} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ) and the distance from the Sun (i.e., Earth's orbital radius \\( R \\approx 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m} \\) , \\( M_{\\text{Earth}} = 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ): \\[ v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2G(M_{\\text{sun}} + M_{\\text{Earth}})}{R}} \\] Efficiency Analysis Time Complexity Series Reduction: Finding a series pair involves checking node degrees, which takes \\(O(V + E)\\) per iteration, where \\(V\\) is the number of nodes and \\(E\\) is the number of edges. Parallel Reduction: Checking for multiple edges is \\(O(E)\\) . Iterations: For series-parallel graphs, the number of reductions is proportional to \\(V + E\\) , as each reduction removes at least one node or edge. Total: Approximately \\(O((V + E)^2)\\) in the worst case for series-parallel graphs. Space Complexity The graph storage requires \\(O(V + E)\\) . Temporary variables use minimal space, so the total is \\(O(V + E)\\) . Limitations The algorithm is limited to series-parallel graphs. Non-series-parallel configurations (e.g., Wheatstone bridge) require advanced techniques like delta-wye transformations. Repeated graph traversals can be inefficient for large graphs. Potential Improvements Advanced Reductions: Implement delta-wye transformations to handle non-series-parallel graphs, allowing the algorithm to process arbitrary circuit topologies. Optimization: Use a priority queue to select the next reduction based on graph structure, reducing unnecessary traversals. Cache node degrees to avoid recomputing them in each iteration. Parallel Processing: For large circuits, parallelize independent reduction steps if the graph can be partitioned. Alternative Methods: Use Laplacian matrix techniques to compute equivalent resistance directly by solving a linear system, though this has a higher complexity ( \\(O(V^3)\\) ). Apply Kirchhoff\u2019s laws or nodal analysis for complex graphs, integrating them with graph-based reductions. Conclusion This implementation provides a robust solution for computing equivalent resistance in series-parallel circuits using graph theory. The algorithm is intuitive, leverages the power of graph representations, and handles nested configurations effectively. While limited to series-parallel graphs, it serves as a foundation for more advanced techniques and demonstrates the synergy between electrical engineering and graph theory. Future enhancements could include support for non-series-parallel graphs and optimized traversal strategies to improve performance on large-scale circuits.","title":"Third Cosmic Velocity"},{"location":"1%20Physics/6%20Statistics/Problem_1/","text":"Problem 1 Simulating Sampling Distributions The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution. We'll simulate this using three population distributions: Uniform Distribution: Range [0, 10]. Exponential Distribution: Rate parameter \\(\\lambda = 1\\) . Binomial Distribution: \\(n = 10\\) , \\(p = 0.5\\) . For each, we generate a large population dataset (10,000 data points). Sampling and Visualization We randomly sample from each population, calculate the sample mean, and repeat this process 1,000 times for sample sizes of 5, 10, 30, and 50. We then plot histograms of the sample means to observe convergence to a normal distribution. Implementation: Python Simulation Below is a Python script that performs the simulation and visualization. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns Results Uniform Distribution: The sampling distribution approaches normality even at small sample sizes (e.g., 10), due to its symmetric nature. Exponential Distribution: Being heavily skewed, it requires a larger sample size (e.g., 30) to approximate normality. Binomial Distribution: With \\(p=0.5\\) , it\u2019s symmetric, so convergence is faster, similar to the uniform case. Parameter Exploration Shape and Sample Size Shape: Skewed distributions (e.g., exponential) converge more slowly to normality than symmetric ones (e.g., uniform, binomial). Sample Size: Larger sample sizes (e.g., 50) consistently produce bell-shaped distributions, confirming the CLT. Impact of Variance The variance of the sampling distribution is given by \\(\\sigma^2/n\\) , where \\(\\sigma^2\\) is the population variance and \\(n\\) is the sample size: Uniform: Variance = \\(\\frac{(10-0)^2}{12} = 8.33\\) ; spread decreases as \\(n\\) increases. Exponential: Variance = \\(1/\\lambda^2 = 1\\) ; larger sample sizes reduce the spread. Binomial: Variance = \\(np(1-p) = 10 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.5 = 2.5\\) ; smaller variance leads to a tighter sampling distribution. 5.
