Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic problem in mechanics that describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity alone, neglecting air resistance initially. Let\u2019s derive the governing equations from Newton\u2019s second law and establish the family of solutions based on initial conditions. Derivation of Equations of Motion Consider a projectile launched from the origin \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) to the horizontal. The only force acting is gravity, with acceleration \\(g\\) downward. We break the motion into horizontal ( \\(x\\) ) and vertical ( \\(y\\) ) components. Horizontal motion : No acceleration, so: $$ a_x = 0 $$ Initial velocity: \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) Position: $$ x(t) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion : Acceleration due to gravity, \\(a_y = -g\\) : Initial velocity: \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Velocity: $$ v_y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Position: $$ y(t) = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ These are parametric equations describing a parabolic trajectory. The family of solutions depends on the free parameters: \\(v_0\\) (initial speed), \\(\\theta\\) (angle of projection), and \\(g\\) (gravitational acceleration). Varying these parameters generates different trajectories. 2. Analysis of the Range The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance traveled when the projectile returns to \\(y = 0\\) . Set \\(y(t) = 0\\) and solve for time of flight \\(t_f\\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factorize: \\[ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 \\] Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) \\(t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) (landing) Substitute \\(t_f = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g}\\) into the horizontal equation: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\(2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta = \\sin 2\\theta\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] Dependence on Angle \\(\\theta\\) Range \\(R\\) is maximized when \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 1\\) , i.e., \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , so \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . \\(R = 0\\) when \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) (no horizontal motion).

Air resistance : Introduce a drag term, e.g., \\(-k v\\) , requiring numerical solutions. 4. Implementation Below is a Python script using NumPy and Matplotlib to simulate and visualize the range as a function of \\(\\theta\\) for different \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) . Discussion on Model Constrains The basic model assumes: Absence of air friction: In reality, projectiles lose speed, which decreases their travel distance.

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) . Implications in Astronomy Mass Determination: Measure \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) of a satellite or moon to calculate \\(M\\) of the central body.

Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities Motivation Escape velocity defines the speed needed to break free from a gravitational field, while cosmic velocities extend this to orbiting and escaping larger systems, critical for space exploration. Definitions and Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): Speed for a circular orbit at radius \\(r\\) : \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\) Derived from balancing gravitational and centripetal forces. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): Speed to escape from radius \\(r\\) to infinity: Energy: \\(\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{G M m}{r}\\) \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_1\\) Third Cosmic Velocity: Speed to escape a star system (e.g., Earth escaping the Sun from its orbit). Approximate as escape from Sun\u2019s field at 1 AU: \\(v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{r_{\\text{AU}}}} \\approx 42.1\\) km/s (from Earth\u2019s orbit). Adjusted for Earth\u2019s motion: \\(v_3 \\approx 16.6\\) km/s relative to Earth. Parameters \\(M\\) : Mass of the body \\(r\\) : Distance from center \\(G\\) : Constant Calculations Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, \\(r = 6,371\\) km: \\(v_1 = 7.9\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 11.2\\) km/s Mars: \\(M = 6.417 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, \\(r = 3,390\\) km: \\(v_1 = 3.6\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 5.0\\) km/s Jupiter: \\(M = 1.898 \\times 10^{27}\\) kg, \\(r = 69,911\\) km: \\(v_1 = 42.1\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 59.5\\) km/s Importance in Space Exploration Satellites: \\(v_1\\) for low Earth orbit (LEO). Planetary Missions: \\(v_2\\) to leave Earth; \\(v_3\\) for solar system escape (e.g., Voyager). Problem 3: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth Motivation A payload released from a rocket follows a trajectory shaped by initial velocity and Earth\u2019s gravity, key to mission design. Possible Trajectories Elliptical: If \\(v < v_2\\) , orbits Earth. Parabolic: If \\(v = v_2\\) , escapes to infinity with zero residual speed. Hyperbolic: If \\(v > v_2\\) , escapes with excess speed. Numerical Analysis Use Newton\u2019s gravitation: \\(\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{G M}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\\) .

This relationship is essential for astronomy and space mission planning, enabling calculations of masses and distances. Derivation for Circular Orbits For a body in a circular orbit around a central mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a planet around the Sun), the gravitational force provides the centripetal force: \\(\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\\) Where: \\(G\\) : Gravitational constant ( \\(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\) m\u00b3 kg\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b2) \\(M\\) : Mass of the central body (kg) \\(m\\) : Mass of the orbiting body (kg) \\(r\\) : Orbital radius (m) \\(v\\) : Orbital velocity (m/s) Simplify by canceling \\(m\\) and multiplying through by \\(r\\) : \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = v^2\\) The orbital velocity relates to the period \\(T\\) via circumference: \\(v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\) Substitute into the force equation: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Rearrange: \\(\\frac{G M}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2}\\) Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(r\\) : \\(G M T^2 = 4\\pi^2 r^3\\) Thus: \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\) This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits, where \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) , and the constant depends on \\(M\\) . Implications in Astronomy Mass Determination: Measure \\(T\\) and \\(r\\) of a satellite or moon to calculate \\(M\\) of the central body. Distance Calculation: Known \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) yield \\(r\\) , aiding in mapping planetary systems. Real-World Examples Moon around Earth: \\(T = 27.32\\) days ( \\(2.36 \\times 10^6\\) s), \\(r = 384,400\\) km ( \\(3.844 \\times 10^8\\) m), \\(M_{\\text{Earth}} = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg. Verify: \\(T^2 \\approx 5.57 \\times 10^{12}\\) s\u00b2, \\(r^3 \\approx 5.68 \\times 10^{25}\\) m\u00b3, constant \\(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} \\approx 9.9 \\times 10^{-14}\\) s\u00b2/m\u00b3 matches. Earth around Sun: \\(T = 1\\) year ( \\(3.156 \\times 10^7\\) s), \\(r = 1\\) AU ( \\(1.496 \\times 10^{11}\\) m), \\(M_{\\text{Sun}} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30}\\) kg. Extension to Elliptical Orbits For elliptical orbits, replace \\(r\\) with the semi-major axis \\(a\\) : \\(T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} a^3\\) This holds universally per Kepler\u2019s Third Law. Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities Motivation Escape velocity defines the speed needed to break free from a gravitational field, while cosmic velocities extend this to orbiting and escaping larger systems, critical for space exploration. Definitions and Derivations First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity): Speed for a circular orbit at radius \\(r\\) : \\(v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}\\) Derived from balancing gravitational and centripetal forces. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity): Speed to escape from radius \\(r\\) to infinity: Energy: \\(\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{G M m}{r}\\) \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} = \\sqrt{2} v_1\\) Third Cosmic Velocity: Speed to escape a star system (e.g., Earth escaping the Sun from its orbit). Approximate as escape from Sun\u2019s field at 1 AU: \\(v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{Sun}}}{r_{\\text{AU}}}} \\approx 42.1\\) km/s (from Earth\u2019s orbit). Adjusted for Earth\u2019s motion: \\(v_3 \\approx 16.6\\) km/s relative to Earth. Parameters \\(M\\) : Mass of the body \\(r\\) : Distance from center \\(G\\) : Constant Calculations Earth: \\(M = 5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg, \\(r = 6,371\\) km: \\(v_1 = 7.9\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 11.2\\) km/s Mars: \\(M = 6.417 \\times 10^{23}\\) kg, \\(r = 3,390\\) km: \\(v_1 = 3.6\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 5.0\\) km/s Jupiter: \\(M = 1.898 \\times 10^{27}\\) kg, \\(r = 69,911\\) km: \\(v_1 = 42.1\\) km/s \\(v_2 = 59.5\\) km/s Importance in Space Exploration Satellites: \\(v_1\\) for low Earth orbit (LEO). Planetary Missions: \\(v_2\\) to leave Earth; \\(v_3\\) for solar system escape (e.g., Voyager). Problem 3: Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth Motivation A payload released from a rocket follows a trajectory shaped by initial velocity and Earth\u2019s gravity, key to mission design. Possible Trajectories Elliptical: If \\(v < v_2\\) , orbits Earth. Parabolic: If \\(v = v_2\\) , escapes to infinity with zero residual speed. Hyperbolic: If \\(v > v_2\\) , escapes with excess speed. Numerical Analysis Use Newton\u2019s gravitation: \\(\\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{G M}{r^3} \\mathbf{r}\\) . Initial conditions: position \\(\\mathbf{r}_0\\) , velocity \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\) , altitude \\(h\\) . Explanations Orbital Period: Log-log plot confirms \\(T^2 \\propto r^3\\) . Cosmic Velocities: Bar chart compares \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\) across bodies. Trajectory: Simulates a circular orbit; adjust \\(v_0\\) for elliptical/hyperbolic paths.
